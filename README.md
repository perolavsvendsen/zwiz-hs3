## zwiz-hs3
Zwiz is a hobby-project attempting to graph my Z-wave network. It is made for visualizing a Z-wave network set up through Homeseer 3 on a UZB1 stick.

The visualisation is done using the fantastic [Dash by Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

Built for personal usage in a very controlled environment. This package must be considered not-maintained. 

## Installation and usage
```
git clone <this repo>
pip install <local repo>
python app.py <ip adress to HS3> <port>
```
